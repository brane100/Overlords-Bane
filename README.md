## 👁️ The Core Vision

### High-Concept
The player begins at the bottom of the inverted spire, trapped by the Overlords’ curse. They must navigate distinct mazes—including a disorienting mirror labyrinth, collapsing spike floors, and cursed sigil vaults—each reflecting an overlord’s domain.

**The Objective:** Climb upward, stabilize collapsing tiers, and reach the apex for balloon extraction before the spire is destroyed.

### Narrative & Theme
The story conveys the oppressive legacy of many cursed overlords whose dominion still haunts the spire. Themes include survival against overwhelming odds, defiance of tyranny, and escape from inevitable collapse.

**Primary Emotion:** Dread mixed with determination. Players should feel the weight of history pressing against them, yet empowered by the chance to defy it.

## 🎨 Look & Feel (Aesthetics)

### Visual Style
*   **Style:** Stylized 3D with sharp geometric architecture, surreal distortions, and muted tones with glowing sigils.
*   **Mood:** Dark, gritty, and oppressive. Eerie silvers/blues for the mirror maze and stark contrasts at the summit.

### Audio & Soundscape
*   **Music:** Ambient & Electronic mixed with cursed chimes and whispers.
*   **Sound Design:** Heavy, impactful effects (echoing footsteps, collapsing stone).
*   **Immersion:** Diegetic sounds dominate to immerse players in the spire’s atmosphere.

### References & Inspirations
*   **Games:** *Dark Souls*, *Slendrina: The Cellar*, *Silent Hill 2*
*   **Cinema:** *Cube (1997)*, *Event Horizon (1997)*

## ⚙️ Gameplay Mechanics & Features

### Core Unique Features
1.  **Inverted Pyramid Architecture:** A collapsing upside-down spire built by cursed overlords.
2.  **Creepy Mirror Maze:** A disorienting labyrinth of reflections and paranoia.
3.  **Tilt Mechanic:** Cursed chimes trigger instability, forcing players to adapt to shifting environments.

### Desired Player Experience
Players should feel **dread**, **urgency**, and **awe** at the spire’s impossible geometry. The intended takeaway is a conversation about the oppressive atmosphere and the thrill of narrowly escaping the collapse.

### 🚀 Stretch Goal: Adaptive Enemy AI
If time permits, we aim to implement **Shadow Wraiths**.
*   **Function:** An AI system that learns player patterns across runs.
*   **Goal:** Wraiths adjust behavior to counter familiar strategies, reinforcing the oppressive presence of the Overlords.

## 💻 Technical Constraints & Scope

To ensure a smooth experience, the development focuses on the following technical pillars:

*   **Performance:** Must maintain **60 FPS** without stuttering, even during heavy collapse sequences and particle effects.
*   **Procedural Generation:** Advanced algorithms required for dynamic maze layouts and tilt mechanics.
*   **Lighting & Rendering:** The Mirror Maze relies on real-time reflections and dynamic lighting (GPU intensive).
*   **AI Systems:** Efficient pathfinding required for adaptive enemies to minimize CPU load.
*   **Hardware Scalability:** Balancing graphical fidelity across various PC configurations.
